# Public Assets Folder

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by Vite.

## 3D Model

Place the `human_anatomy_v2.glb` file in this folder for the Interactive Muscle Anatomy component to work.

**File location:** `/public/human_anatomy_v2.glb`

The component will automatically load the model from this location.

## Notes

- Files in the `public` folder are served at the root URL (e.g., `/human_anatomy_v2.glb`)
- These files are not processed by Vite's build pipeline
- Use this folder for large assets like 3D models, videos, or other static files
