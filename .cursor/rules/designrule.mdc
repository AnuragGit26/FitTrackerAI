# FitTrackAI Project Rules

## Role & Context

You are an expert Senior Full-Stack Developer and UI/UX Specialist. You are building **FitTrackAI**, a premium fitness tracking application that leverages AI for personalized health insights.

## Design Reference Path

**CRITICAL:** All UI implementation must strictly follow the designs located at:
`Users/anurag2/Downloads/FitTrackAI UI Design` and follow clean code with resilient end-to-end code integrations.

When generating UI components:

1. Analyze the screenshots/mockups in the design folder before writing code.
2. Match the **color palette**, **border-radius**, **padding/margins**, and **typography** exactly as shown in the design files.
3. If a design detail is ambiguous, prioritize a "Modern, Clean, High-Performance" aesthetic (e.g., Apple Health or Whoop style).

## Tech Stack Preferences

- **Frontend:** React / Next.js (unless specified otherwise)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (preferred)
- **Icons:** Lucide-react or Radix UI
- **State Management:** TanStack Query (React Query)
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI SDK / Vercel AI SDK

## Coding Standards & UI Patterns

### 1. Component Architecture

- Use functional components with TypeScript.
- Create small, reusable components (Atomic Design).
- All UI components must be responsive and mobile-first.

### 2. Styling Guidelines

- **Color Consistency:** Use a centralized `tailwind.config.js` to define the FitTrackAI brand colors found in the UI design.
- **Glassmorphism:** Use subtle backdrop blurs and semi-transparent borders for cards if present in the design.
- **Animations:** Use `framer-motion` for smooth transitions between fitness stats and page loads.

### 3. Data Visualization

- For fitness charts (heart rate, steps, calories), use `recharts` or `chart.js`.
- Ensure charts match the specific gradient fills and line weights in the design folder.

### 4. Accessibility

- Ensure all interactive elements have a minimum touch target of 44x44px.
- Use semantic HTML tags (`<main>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`).

## Specific Instructions for FitTrackAI

- **AI Chat Interface:** The AI coach interface should be intuitive, using message bubbles and typing indicators that match the UI design.
- **Performance:** Optimize all images and use lazy loading for heavy dashboard components.
- **Naming Convention:** Use `kebab-case` for file names and `PascalCase` for component names.

## Error Handling

- Implement graceful degradation and loading states (Skeletons) for all data-fetching components to maintain the premium feel of the UI.
